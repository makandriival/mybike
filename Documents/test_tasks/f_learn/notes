<!-- DESCRIPTION

Apart from the general backlog of details, which will have to be shared in a phase following the acceptance of this proposal and the subsequent constitution of the team/scrum, the key points of the solution will be: -->

<!-- no need for restyling (UX/UI) or mockups provided
backend shared with the webapp (via API) -->

for pdf reader there is flutter_pdfview library - https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pdfview

single login across multiple platforms
  needs more info on theirs website login logic. An acces to their user database to create new users credentials 
  as well as checking an existing one on login

third-party application for common flipbook reading
  need to check libraries for the flipbook reading

flipbooks viewable offline 
  <!-- Shared Preferences:
  Shared Preferences is a simple key-value storage mechanism provided by Flutter for storing small amounts of data such as user settings or preferences. This data can be accessed even when the app is offline. -->

  <!-- Local Database (SQLite):
  For more structured and larger datasets, you can use a local database. SQLite is a popular choice for mobile apps. The sqflite package is commonly used in Flutter to interact with SQLite databases. -->

  <!-- Caching Libraries:
  You can use caching libraries like flutter_cache_manager or hive to cache data, such as images or JSON responses, for offline use. These libraries handle caching and retrieval of data efficiently. -->

share buttons
<!-- flutter_share:
The flutter_share package allows you to share text, images, and URLs to various social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and more.

share:
The share package provides a simple way to share text and URLs across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, email, and more.

flipbooks readable in "article" format? (optional if the tool allows it)
  <!-- does this mean just text not images? -->

should not have in-app purchases

issue push notifications for new releases
  <!-- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): Firebase Cloud Messaging is a widely used platform for sending push notifications to both Android and iOS devices. Flutter has excellent integration with FCM through the firebase_messaging package, which makes it easy to handle push notifications in your app. -->

  <!-- OneSignal:
  OneSignal is a cross-platform push notification service that offers a Flutter SDK for easy integration. It provides features like audience targeting, segmentation, and scheduling.
  Package link: onesignal_flutter
  OneSignal allows you to send notifications to users based on specific criteria and supports a variety of notification types, including images and buttons. -->

  <!-- Local Notifications:
  Local notifications are notifications that are triggered by your app itself, rather than being sent from a server. Flutter provides the flutter_local_notifications package, which enables you to display local notifications on both Android and iOS devices.
  Package link: flutter_local_notifications
  This package allows you to schedule and customize local notifications, making them useful for reminders and other app-specific notifications. -->

App analytics: Tracking access / readings / bookmarks / dwell time
  <!-- Firebase Analytics: This is a powerful analytics solution provided by Google. It offers a Flutter plugin, firebase_analytics, that allows you to track various events and user interactions.

  Amplitude: Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics platform that supports tracking user actions, events, and more. The amplitude_flutter package provides integration with Flutter apps.

  Mixpanel: Mixpanel is another analytics platform that allows you to track user actions and events. The mixpanel_flutter package enables integration with your Flutter app. -->

Bookmark / Preference of editorial sections / flipbooks (sync with fooddata)

<!-- Optional and only at the end of the realization of the requirements listed above and if the team has time:
Newsletter archive
Survey/polls (app or both - typeform.com embedded) -->
